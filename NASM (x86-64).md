# NASM (x86-64) - Netwide Assembler

NASM is an assembler for x86 and x86-64 processors. It uses Intel-style syntax. This documentary is just simplifying the stuff for it.

## Moving Data

- **mov**: Copies data from one location to another. Use is `mov <register>, <data>`
- **movzx**: Same as `mov` but with zero extension. Use is `movzx <register>, <data>`
- **movsx**: Same as `mov` but with sign extension. Use is `movsx <register>, <data>`
- **push**: Takes the value from a register to the top of the stack. Use is `push <register>`
- **pop**: This is the opposite, it takes the value from the stack and to the register. Use is `pop <register>`
- **lea**: Calculates an address via register + data, before moving it to a specified register. Use is `lea <register>, <[register + data]>`
- **xchg**: Swaps the values of two operands (register or memory location). Use is `xchg <operand1>, <operand2>`
- **movabs**: Moves a full 64-bit value into a 64-bit register. Use is `movabs <register>, <0x123456789ABCDEF0>`

## Extending

- **Zero extension**: This fills the extra bits with 0. 
<br>For example:
<br>`movzx rax, al` - If 'al' contains 1111 1010 (250 as an unsigned number). After zero extension is 00000000 00000000 ... 1111 1010, still 250.

- **Sign extension**: This fills the extra bits with copies of the number's sign bit.
<br>For example:
<br>`movsx rax, al` - If 'al' contain 1111 1010 (-6 as a signed 8-bit number). After sign extension is 11111111 11111111 ... 1111 1010, still -6.

## Registers

Registers are small and fast storage locations used to hold data, addresses and results. They can only hold a specific size or amount of data or integer value, for example 64-bit is 2 to the 64th power of unsigned values (18,446,744,073,709,551,616), 32-bit is 2 to the 32nd power of unsigned values (4,294,967,296), 16-bit is 2 to the 16th power of unsigned values (65,636), 8-bit is 2 to the 8th power of unsigned values (256).

These are the 64-bit registers.

**RAX**, **RBX**, **RCX**, **RDX**, **RSI**, **RDI**, **RBP**, **RSP**, and **R8** up to **R15**

And these are the sub-registers, which are the parts of a register (For example, RAX).
<br>**EAX** (32 bits), **AX** (16 bits), **AL** (8 bits), and **AH** (8-15 bits)

## Stack

The Stack is a part of RAM or Memory used for temporary data. Compared to the Registers, this is

**RSP**: Pointer to the top of the stack.

The stack's size is only limited to available memory given.

## Comments

A comment is text ignored by the assembler, which is useful for explaining and documenting the code. It starts with a semicolon.
```nasm
;This is a comment using the semicolon.
```

## Mathematics

- **add**: Adds two values. Use is `add <operand>, <value>`
- **sub**: Subtracts two values. Use is `sub <operand>, <value>`
- **inc**: Increases a value by one. Use is `inc <operand>`
- **dec**: Decreases a value by one. Use is `dec <operand>`
- **imul**: Multiplies signed integers. Use is `imul <operand>, <value>`
- **mul**: Multiplies unsigned integers. Use is `mul <operand>, <value>`
- **idiv**: Divides signed integers. Use is `idiv <operand>, <value>`
- **div**: Divides unsigned integers. Use is `div <operand>, <value>`
- **neg**: Turns a value to a negative. Use is `neg <operand>`

## Bit Operations

- **and**: Performs a bit-by-bit AND operation. AND outputs 1 only when the bits in the same position in both operands are 1. Use is `and <operand1>, <operand2>`
- **or**: Performs a bit-by-bit OR operation. OR outputs 1 if atleast one of the bits in the same position of the two operands is 1. Use is `or <operand1>, <operand2>`
- **xor**: Performs a bit-by-bit XOR operation. XOR outputs 1 if the bits in the same position of the two operands has a difference. Use is `xor <operand1>, <operand2>`
- **not**: Flips the bits like a switch. 1 becomes 0 and 0 becomes 1. Use is `not <operand>`
- **shl**: Shifts the bits to the left by a given amount. Use is `shl <operand>, <amount>`
- **shr**: Same concept as `shl`, but it shifts right. Use is `shr <operand>, <amount>`
- **sar**: Shifts all the bits to the right while preserving the left side of the bits. Use is `sar <operand>, <amount>`

## Comparisons and Conditions:

- **cmp**: Compares two operands by subtracting them without storing the result. Use is cmp <operand1>, <operand2>
- **test**: Performs a bit AND operation without storing the result, this is used to check whether a value is zero. Use is `test <operand1>, <operand2>`
- **jz**: Jumps to a specified label if the previous comparison was zero. Use is `jz <label>`
- **jnz**: Jumps to a specified label if the previous comparison was zero. Use is `jnz <label>`
- **jg**: Jumps to a specified label if the previous comparison's first operand was greater than the second operand. Use is `jg <label>`
- **jl**: Jumps to a specified label if the previous comparison's first operand was lesser than the second operand. Use is `jl <label>`
- **je**: Jumps to a specified label if the previous comparison's first operand is equal to the second operand. Use is `je <label>`
- **jne**: Jumps to a specified label if the previous comparions's first operand is not equal to the second operand. Use is `jne <label>`

## Extra Jumps:

- **ja**: Jumps if the first value is above the second value, using unsigned numbers. Use is `ja <label>`
- **jb**: Jumps if the first value is below the second value, using unsigned numbers. Use is `jb <label>`
- **jae**: Jumps if the first value is above or equal to the second value, using unsigned numbers. Use is `jae <label>`
- **jbe**: Jumps if the first value is below or equal to the second value, using unsigned numbers. Use is `jbe <label>`
- **jge**: Jumps if the first value is greater than or equal to the second value, using signed numbers. Use is `jge <label>`
- **jle**: Jumps if the first value is less than or equal to the second value, using signed numbers. Use is `jle <label>`

## Labels (Functions):

- **jmp**: Jumps to the specified label. Use is `jmp <label>`
- **call**: Calls the specified label like a function. Use is `call <label>`

There are two types of labels. Global and Local. The global labels can either start with letters, underscores (_), or question marks (?) and end with a colon (:). The local labels start with a dot and also ends with a colon. `_start:` is a global label that Linux looks for in x86-64 Assembly that is where the very first instruction of the code lives. But the linker doesn't know so you need to tell the linker that it exists and public using `global`. You dont need to use tabs or any whitespaces but it's recommended to use them for readability:

For example:

```nasm
section .text
    global start

_start:
    mov eax, 60
    mov edi, 0
    syscall
```

There are different types of starting global label in each operating system `_start` for Linux and `_main` for both Windows and Mac

## Sections

A section is a named, division of a program that tells the system how to load, organize, and protect different types of data and code in physical memory. Stated using `section <section>`. 

These are the different types of sections:
- `.text`: The actual executable CPU instructions containing stuff like mov, add, syscall, etc. The system marks this as read-only so that malicious code cannot modify it.
- `.data`: Containing the static variables that the user has given with a starting value. This is a read-write.
- `.bss`: Reserved for variables that don't have a starting value when the program starts, for example... an empty buffer meant to hold user input later. This section takes up zero space inside the actual compiled file on your disk.The system simply allocates the requested amount of RAM and zeroes it out when the program starts.
- `.rodata`: Similar to .data but its read-only meaning constants.

## Syscall

Syscall is used to ask the kernel to perform something because the code is locked to Ring 3 (The Kernel is in Ring 0 which has full control over the hardware.) The CPU pauses the execution for the .text code, it saves the current pointer location, switching to Ring 0. The kernel looks at the `RAX` register to see what number is in it, if it is 1, it jumps to its own internal sys_write code and if it's 60, it jumps to its sys_exit code. It reads the arguments from `RDI`, `RSI`, and `RDX` (It may point to the .data or .bss sections) and physically drives the hardware (For example, sending characters to the terminal.) It returns the result to RAX register then flips the CPU back to Ring 3. You can find different syscalls in the internet, it's very OS-dependent.

## Memory Addressing

Memory addresses or operands are surrounded by brackets.

These are the examples:
```nasm
mov rax [rbx]
mov rax [rbx + 8]
mov rax, [rbx + rcx*4 + 16]
```

## Data Sizes

Data sizes are how much data an instruction operates on or stores.

**byte**      =  8-bit = 1 byte
<br>**word**  = 16-bit = 2 bytes
<br>**dword** = 32-bit = 4 bytes
<br>**qword** = 64-bit = 8 bytes

For example:
```nasm
mov al, 10    ; 8-bit
mov ax, 10    ; 16-bit
mov eax, 10   ; 32-bit
mov rax, 10   ; 64-bit
```

It matters especially with memory operands. `mov byte [address], 10` stores 1 byte, while `mov qword [address], 10` stores 8 bytes.

## Strings

A string is a group of characters stored next to each other in memory. Assembly does not have a built-in string type, so strings are stored as bytes.

For example:
```nasm
message db "Hello, World!", 10
```

`db` means define byte. Each character takes one byte. The 10 adds a newline.

You can get the address of a string using `lea`.
```nasm
lea rsi, [message]
```


## Arrays

An array is a group of values stored next to each other in memory. Assembly does not have a built-in array type.

For example:
```nasm
numbers dd 10, 20, 30, 40
```
This creates an array containing four 32-bit numbers.

You can access an element using an index.
```nasm
mov eax, [numbers + rcx*4]
```

The 4 is used because each number is 4 bytes.


## Data Definition

Data definition instructions are used to put values directly into memory.

- **db**: Defines a byte (8-bit values). Use is `db <value>`
- **dw**: Defines a word (16-bit values). Use is `dw <value>`
- **dd**: Defines a dword (32-bit values). Use is `dd <value>`
- **dq**: Defines a qword (64-bit values). Use is `dq <value>`

For example:
```nasm
db 10
dw 1000
dd 100000
dq 1000000000
```

## Null Terminator

A null terminator is a byte with the value 0 placed at the end of a string. It tells programs where the string ends.

For example:
```nasm
message db "Hello", 0
```


## Times

`times` repeats a data definition a certain number of times.

For example:
```nasm
buffer times 64 db 0
```
This creates 64 bytes filled with 0.


## Reserved Memory

- **resb**: Reserves bytes.
- **resw**: Reserves words.
- **resd**: Reserves dwords.
- **resq**: Reserves qwords.

For example:
```nasm
buffer resb 64
```
This reserves 64 bytes of memory.


## Flags:

Flags are small pieces of information stored by the CPU about the result of an operation.

- **ZF**: Zero Flag. Set when the result is zero.
- **CF**: Carry Flag. Set when an unsigned operation produces a carry or borrow.
- **SF**: Sign Flag. Set when the result is negative.
- **OF**: Overflow Flag. Set when a signed operation produces a result that is too large or too small.

For example:
```nasm
cmp rax, rbx
je equal
```
If `RAX` and `RBX` are equal, `cmp` sets the Zero Flag and `je` jumps to equal.


## Loops:

Assembly does not have built-in for or while loops. Loops are made using labels and jumps.

For example:
```nasm
mov rcx, 5

loop_start:
    dec rcx
    jnz loop_start
```

This keeps decreasing RCX until it becomes zero.

**loop**: Decreases RCX by one and jumps to a label if RCX is not zero. Use is `loop <label>`

## Label (Functions) 2:

A function is a section of code that can be called from another section of code.

For example:
```nasm
my_function:
    mov rax, 123
    ret
```

You can call it using:
```nasm
call my_function
```

- **call**: Saves the address of the next instruction on the stack, and jumps to the function.
- **ret**: Takes that saved address from the stack, and jumps back to it.


## Function Arguments

Arguments are values given to a function.

On Linux x86-64, the first six integer or pointer arguments normally go into:

- **RDI**: First argument
- **RSI**: Second argument
- **RDX**: Third argument
- **RCX**: Fourth argument
- **R8**: Fifth argument
- **R9**: Sixth argument

The return value normally goes into **RAX**.


## Calling Conventions

A calling convention is a set of rules that tells functions how to communicate with each other.

It determines where arguments go, where return values go, which registers can be changed, and how the stack is used.

Linux and Windows use different calling conventions.


## Pointers

A pointer is a value that contains a memory address.

For example:
```nasm
lea rax, [message]
```

RAX now contains the address of message.

You can use that address to access the data.
```nasm
mov bl, [rax]
```
This reads the byte stored at the address in RAX.

A pointer contains an address, not the actual data.


## Address Math

Addresses can be calculated using registers, constants, and indexes.

For example:
```nasm
mov eax, [rbx + rcx*4 + 8]
```

The CPU calculates the address as:

`RBX + RCX * 4 + 8`

This is useful for accessing arrays.

The scale can normally be 1, 2, 4, or 8.


## Structures

A structure is a group of different values stored together in memory.

For example, a structure could have a 32-bit value at offset 0 and another 32-bit value at offset 4.

You can access a value using its offset.

For example:
```nasm
mov eax, [rbx + 4]
```
This accesses the value 4 bytes after the address in RBX.


## Heap

The heap is memory used for data that is allocated while the program is running.

Assembly does not have a universal malloc or free instruction. The program normally asks the operating system or a library to allocate and free heap memory.

The exact method depends on the operating system.


## Program Flow

The CPU normally executes instructions in order.

Jumps, calls, returns, and conditional jumps can change this order.

For example.

```nasm
mov rax, 1
cmp rax, 1
je equal

mov rbx, 0
jmp done

equal:
    mov rbx, 1

done:
```

The CPU checks the comparison and chooses where to continue.

This is how things like if statements, loops, and functions are created using assembly.
